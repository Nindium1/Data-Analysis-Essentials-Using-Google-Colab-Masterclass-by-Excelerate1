# Data Analysis Essentials Using Google Colab

This repository documents my learning journey and project work for the Excelerate Data Analysis Program; a course designed to equip participants with practical data analytics, visualization, and reporting skills.

## Course Overview
The Excelerate Data Analysis Course is a hands-on 3-session program focusing on real-world data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization using Google Colab (cloud-based Python environment).

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas: Data Manipulation and Analysis
- NumPy: Numerical computing and array operations
- Matplotlib: Data Visualization
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization
- Google Colab: Cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment

## Program Objectives
- Apply fundamental data analysis concepts to a real dataset  
- Document Google Colab notebooks for each session  
- Exploring and interpreting Datasets

##  Course Sessions
## Session 1: Python Fundamentals
### We Covered:
- Variables, data types, and mathematical operations
- Lists and dictionaries
- Conditionals and functions
- Pandas DataFrames
- NumPy arrays
- Matplotlib & Seaborn visualizations

### Exercises Completed:
- Built a discount calculator function
- Created and manipulated student grade DataFrames
- Analyzed sales data with NumPy arrays
- Generated multiple chart types (line plots, bar charts, count plots, heatmaps)

### Skills Acquired:
- Python syntax and data structures
- DataFrame creation and manipulation
- Array operations and statistical functions
- Basic data visualization




## Session 2: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis
Dataset: Sales Transactions (3,500+ records)
### We Covered:
#### 1. Data Quality Assessment

- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Examined data types and structure

#### 2. Handling Missing Values;
Explored and compared 4 different methods:

- Method 1: Removal (dropping rows)
- Method 2: Mean imputation
- Method 3: Median imputation ✓ (selected)
- Method 4: Group-based imputation (by gender)

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Generated summary statistics
- Analyzed customer demographics
- Examined purchasing patterns
- Explored sales by region, category, and payment method

#### 4. Data Visualizations (6 types created)

- Age Distribution: Histogram showing customer age range
- Sales by Category: Bar chart of total sales per product category
- Regional Sales: Pie chart showing sales distribution
- Price Distribution: Histogram with mean/median indicators
- Gender vs Category: Heatmap showing purchase patterns
- Payment Methods: Horizontal bar chart of payment preferences

#### 5. Pattern Analysis

- Created age groups (18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56+)
- Analyzed spending by age bracket
- Deep-dived into product category performance

### Key Insights Discovered:

- Identified top-selling product categories
- Discovered regional sales patterns and distributions
- Analyzed customer age demographics
- Compared payment method preferences across customer segments

### Skills Acquired:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Multiple methods for handling missing data
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- Creating meaningful visualizations
- Pattern recognition and insight generation



## Session 3: Data Exploration and Preparation

Will finish documenting this

## GETTING STARTED
### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8 or higher
Google Colab account or Jupyter Notebook
```

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nindium1/Data-Analysis-Essentials-Using-Google-Colab-Masterclass-by-Excelerate1.git
cd Data-Analysis-Essentials-Using-Google-Colab-Masterclass-by-Excelerate
```

### Install required libraries
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

- Open notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or upload to Google Colab
- Each notebook is self-contained with detailed explanations
- Dataset is provided in the data folder
- Follow along with the code and comments


## Notes
This repository serves as both a learning portfolio and a reference for fundamental data analysis techniques. Each notebook includes:

- Clear, commented code
- Visual outputs and interpretations
- Key takeaways and learning points
- Step-by-step explanations
